# Homelabs

This repository documents the setup, configuration, and maintenance of my homelab environment.

I'll keep this short; the whole idea behind this project is to demonstrate my appetite for learning new things and applying them to simulated real-world environments. I plan to build each homelab iteration on top of the previous one, expanding in a progressive manner.

## How I Plan for It to Go

- **Phase 1:** AD Setup & Basic Config
- **Phase 2:** Firewalls & Network Segmentation
- **Phase 3:** SIEM Setup (Splunk, Wazuh, ELK)
- **Phase 4:** Honeypot Creation & Deployment
- **Phase 5:** Attack Simulations & Incident Response
